The code for the slider was based on [Guide](https://lastminuteengineers.com/a4988-stepper-motor-driver-arduino-tutorial/amp/) with slight modification to react when enter is pressed on the computer. At the moment it moves forward 5mm each time in one direction. If one wishes to change direction one would then need to comment away line 25 and 44 and replace them with line 26 and 45 respectively.
